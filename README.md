## About The Project

Abstract
The aim of the Diploma Thesis is the design and development of an Online Reservation System for electric bicycle charging based on microservices architecture. The System will allow end-users to create charging station locations or make reservations online, while utilizing Google's geographic and other cloud services. 
More specifically the above System includes:
  A.	An application based on the Android SDK, which interfaces with the battery of the electric bicycle (via simulation). The total distance between the rider and the charging stations is calculated. Then the calculations continue on how much distance can be traveled to a selected point, using the electric motor of the bicycle and finally how much distance remains for which the rider is required to cycle in order to reach the desired point .
  B.	A web application based on Angular framework, which enables the owners to create new charging stations for reservations or edit the existing ones. Moreover they may have total supervision, which includes automatic or manual acceptance/rejection of made reservations.
  C.	All the applications and subsystems will be loosely coupled with each other and will be focused on utilizing the microservices architecture as well as the relevant technology stack, so as to achieve the necessary independence between them, which in turn will bring multiple benefits both in terms of management and scalability.
